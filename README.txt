Voodoo Mansion is a top down shoot 'em up style horror game where you play as Big Jim, a police-officer who returns home only to find that a mysterious force has taken over his childhood home. You must traverse the mansion fighting enemies at every corner. If you want a story make sure you stop to read the notes and if you want to make it easier make sure to pick up the needles which increase your stats along the way.
